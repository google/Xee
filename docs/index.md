# Xee: A Google Earth Engine extension for Xarray

Xee is an Xarray extension for Google Earth Engine. It aims to help users view
Earth Engine's [data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets)
through the lense of arrays.

In this documentation, we assume readers have some familiarity with
[Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/),
and Python. Here, we'll dive into core concepts related to the integration
between these tools.
