# Xee: Xarray + Google Earth Engine

![Xee Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/Xee/main/docs/xee-logo.png)

_An Xarray extension for Google Earth Engine._

Xee bridges the gap between Google Earth Engine's massive data catalog and the scientific Python ecosystem. It provides a custom Xarray backend that allows you to open any `ee.ImageCollection` as if it were a local `xarray.Dataset`. Data is loaded lazily and in parallel, enabling you to work with petabyte-scale archives of satellite and climate data using the power and flexibility of Xarray and its integrations with libraries like Dask.

## How to use

Install with pip:

```shell
pip install --upgrade xee
```

Install with conda:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge xee
```

Then, authenticate Earth Engine:

```shell
earthengine authenticate --quiet
```

Now, in your Python environment, make the following imports and initialize the Earth Engine client with your project ID. Using the high-volume API endpoint is recommended.

```python
import ee
import xarray as xr
from xee import helpers
import shapely

ee.Initialize(
    project='PROJECT-ID',  # Replace with your project ID
    opt_url='https://earthengine-highvolume.googleapis.com'
)
```

### Specifying the Output Grid

To open a dataset, you must specify the desired output pixel grid. The `xee.helpers` module simplifies this process by providing several convenient workflows, summarized below.

| Goal | Method | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Match Source Grid** | Use `helpers.extract_grid_params()` to get the parameters from an EE object. | When you want the data in its original, default projection and scale. |
| **Fit Area to a Shape** | Use `helpers.fit_geometry()` with the `geometry` and `grid_shape` arguments. | When you need a consistent output array size (e.g., for ML models) and the exact pixel size is less important. |
| **Fit Area to a Scale** | Use `helpers.fit_geometry()` with the `geometry` and `grid_scale` arguments. | When the specific resolution (e.g., 30 meters, 0.01 degrees) is critical for your analysis. |
| **Manual Override** | Pass `crs`, `crs_transform`, and `shape_2d` directly to `xr.open_dataset`. | For advanced cases where you already have an exact grid definition. |

> **Important Note on Units:** All grid parameter values must be in the units of the specified Coordinate Reference System (`crs`).
> * For a geographic CRS like `'EPSG:4326'`, the units are in **degrees**.
> * For a projected CRS like `'EPSG:32610'` (UTM), the units are in **meters**.
> This applies to the translation values in `crs_transform` and the pixel sizes in `grid_scale`.

### Usage Examples

Here are common workflows for opening datasets with `xee`, corresponding to the methods in the table above.

#### Match Source Grid

This is the simplest case, using `helpers.extract_grid_params` to match the dataset's default grid.

```python
ic = ee.ImageCollection('ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR')
grid_params = helpers.extract_grid_params(ic)
ds = xr.open_dataset(ic, engine='ee', **grid_params)
```

#### Fit Area to a Shape

Define a grid over an area of interest by specifying the number of pixels. `helpers.fit_geometry` will calculate the correct `crs_transform`.

```python
aoi = shapely.geometry.box(113.33, -43.63, 153.56, -10.66) # Australia
grid_params = helpers.fit_geometry(
    geometry=aoi,
    grid_crs='EPSG:4326',
    grid_shape=(256, 256)
)

ds = xr.open_dataset('ee://ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR', engine='ee', **grid_params)
```

#### Fit Area to a Scale (Resolution)

> **A Note on `grid_scale` and Y-Scale Orientation**
> When using `fit_geometry` with `grid_scale`, you are defining both the pixel size and the grid's orientation via the sign of the y-scale.
> * A **negative `y_scale`** (e.g., `(10000, -10000)`) is the standard for "north-up" satellite and aerial imagery, creating a grid with a **top-left** origin.
> * A **positive `y_scale`** (e.g., `(10000, 10000)`) is used by some datasets and creates a grid with a **bottom-left** origin.
> You may need to inspect your source dataset's projection information to determine the correct sign to use. If you use `grid_shape`, a standard negative y-scale is assumed.

The following example defines a grid over an area by specifying the pixel size in meters. `fit_geometry` will reproject the geometry and calculate the correct `shape_2d`.

```python
aoi = shapely.geometry.box(113.33, -43.63, 153.56, -10.66) # Australia
grid_params = helpers.fit_geometry(
    geometry=aoi,
    geometry_crs='EPSG:4326',       # CRS of the input geometry
    grid_crs='EPSG:32662',          # Target CRS in meters (Plate Carr√©e)
    grid_scale=(10000, -10000)      # Define a 10km pixel size
)

ds = xr.open_dataset('ee://ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR', engine='ee', **grid_params)
```

#### Open a Custom Region at Source Resolution

This workflow is ideal for analyzing a specific area while maintaining the dataset's original resolution.

```python
# 1. Get the original grid parameters from the target ImageCollection
ic = ee.ImageCollection('ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR')
source_params = helpers.extract_grid_params(ic)

# 2. Extract the source CRS and scale
source_crs = source_params['crs']
source_transform = source_params['crs_transform']
source_scale = (source_transform[0], source_transform[4]) # (x_scale, y_scale)

# 3. Use the source parameters to fit the grid to a specific geometry
aoi = shapely.geometry.box(113.33, -43.63, 153.56, -10.66) # Australia
final_grid_params = helpers.fit_geometry(
    geometry=aoi,
    geometry_crs='EPSG:4326',
    grid_crs=source_crs,
    grid_scale=source_scale
)

# 4. Open the dataset with the final, combined parameters
ds = xr.open_dataset(ic, engine='ee', **final_grid_params)
```

#### Manual Override

For use cases where you know the exact grid parameters, you can provide them directly.

```python
# Manually define a 512x512 pixel grid with 1-degree pixels in EPSG:4326
manual_crs = 'EPSG:4326'
manual_transform = (0.1, 0, -180.05, 0, -0.1, 90.05) # Values are in degrees
manual_shape = (512, 512)

ds = xr.open_dataset(
    'ee://ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR',
    engine='ee',
    crs=manual_crs,
    crs_transform=manual_transform,
    shape_2d=manual_shape,
)
```

#### Open a Pre-Processed ImageCollection

A key feature of Xee is its ability to open a computed `ee.ImageCollection`. This allows you to leverage Earth Engine's powerful server-side processing for tasks like filtering, band selection, and calculations before loading the data into Xarray.

```python
# Define an AOI as a shapely object for the helper function
sf_aoi_shapely = shapely.geometry.Point(-122.4, 37.7).buffer(0.2)
# Create an ee.Geometry from the shapely object for server-side filtering
coords = list(sf_aoi_shapely.exterior.coords)
sf_aoi_ee = ee.Geometry.Polygon(coords)

# Define a function to calculate NDVI and add it as a band
def add_ndvi(image):
    # Landsat 9 SR bands: NIR = B5, Red = B4
    ndvi = image.normalizedDifference(['SR_B5', 'SR_B4']).rename('NDVI')
    return image.addBands(ndvi)

# Build the pre-processed collection
processed_collection = (ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1_L2')
    .filterDate('2024-06-01', '2024-09-01')
    .filterBounds(sf_aoi_ee)
    .map(add_ndvi)
    .select(['NDVI']))

# Define the output grid using a helper
grid_params = helpers.fit_geometry(
    geometry=sf_aoi_shapely,
    grid_crs='EPSG:32610',     # Target CRS in meters (UTM Zone 10N)
    grid_scale=(30, -30)        # Use Landsat's 30m resolution
)

# Open the fully processed collection
ds = xr.open_dataset(processed_collection, engine='ee', **grid_params)
```

#### Open a single Image

The `helpers` work the same way for a single `ee.Image`.

```python
img = ee.Image('ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR/202501')
grid_params = helpers.extract_grid_params(img)
ds = xr.open_dataset(img, engine='ee', **grid_params)
```

#### Visualize a Single Time Slice

Once you have your `xarray.Dataset`, you can visualize a single time slice of a variable to verify the results. This requires the `matplotlib` library, which is an optional dependency.

If you don't have it installed, you can add it with pip:

```shell
pip install matplotlib
```

Xarray's plotting functions expect dimensions in `(y, x)` order for 2D plots. Since the data is in `(x, y)` order, we use `.transpose()` to swap the axes for correct visualization.

```python

# First, open a dataset using one of the methods above
aoi = shapely.geometry.box(113.33, -43.63, 153.56, -10.66) # Australia
grid_params = helpers.fit_geometry(
    geometry=aoi,
    grid_crs='EPSG:4326',
    grid_shape=(256, 256)
)
ds = xr.open_dataset('ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR', engine='ee', **grid_params)

# Select the 2m air temperature for the first time step
temp_slice = ds['temperature_2m'].isel(time=0)

# Transpose from (x, y) to (y, x) for correct plotting orientation and plot
temp_slice.transpose('y', 'x').plot()
```
